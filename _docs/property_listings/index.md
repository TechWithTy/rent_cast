## Data Sources and Coverage

Our property listing data is obtained from various public sources, including online records and directories, and public domain information.

We continuously update our property listing database, and each individual listing is updated at least once per day. Newly published listings are typically ingested and made available through our API within 12-24 hours of being published.

Although we do not retrieve our property listing data directly from the MLS, you should see comparable coverage between your local MLS feeds and our API.

We aim to provide at least 96% sale and rental listing coverage for residential properties in all 50 US states, including single-family, condos, townhomes, manufactured, and 2-4 unit multi-family properties. This includes sale listings of vacant land parcels.

We also aim to provide at least 90% sale and rental listing coverage for 5+ unit commercial dwellings, including apartment buildings, condo complexes, and other large residential developments. At this time, we do not have property listing coverage for office, retail, industrial, manufacturing, farm or other non-residential commercial properties.

## Pagination

Our property listing search endpoints ([`/listings/sale`](https://developers.rentcast.io/reference/sale-listings) and [`/listings/rental/long-term`](https://developers.rentcast.io/reference/rental-listings-long-term)) will return large lists of listings in sets, up to 500 listings at a time, and support pagination.

[See this guide](https://developers.rentcast.io/reference/pagination) for an overview of how to use the `limit` and `offset` query parameters to retrieve additional sets of results.
